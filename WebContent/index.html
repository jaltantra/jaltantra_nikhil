<h2> Description </h2>
<img src="/jaltantra/Images/South_Mokhada_Tanker_Fed_map.png" height="400" width="400" alt="Mokhada Tanker-Fed Villages" style="border:2px solid black"/>

<p>
Above is a Google Earth image of tanker fed villages in the Mokhada taluka of Thane. <br>
We would like to design a piped water network to alleviate their water problems. <br>
A typical multi village design consists of the following components: <br>
Source <br>
MBR (Mass Balancing Reservoir) <br>
WTP (Water Treatment Plant) <br>
ESR (Elevated Storage Reservoirs) <br> 
Demand points <br>
Pipes connecting all of the above <br>
Pumps <br>
Valves <br>
</p>
<img src="/jaltantra/Images/Network_Design.jpg" alt="Typical Network Design" style="border:2px solid black"/>

<p>Designing a particular scheme means locating and sizing each of the above components. <br>
Which source do we use? <br>
Where do we place our ESRs in terms of location as well as elevation. <br>
What should be its capacity? <br>
What should be the diameter of the pipes? <br>
The aim of the design is to satisfy the water demand of each village and at the same time minimize capital and/or operational cost of the design. <br>
Therefore the questions have to be answered in light of that objective.<br>
In the first iteration of our system, we attempt to optimize the pipe diameters given the location and demand of the ESRs.
<br>
We have now also integrated ESR selection (location, height, capacity as well as which nodes it serves) into the optimization.
